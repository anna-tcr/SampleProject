### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the sales performance of an e-commerce company over the past year. By analysing various aspects od the sales
data, we seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations and gain deeper understanding of the company performance
### Data sources
Sales data: The primary dataset used for analysis is the "sales_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sales by the company
### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creatubg reports
### Data Cleaning and preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data Cleaning and formatting.
### Exploratory Data analysis involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:
- What is the overal sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- Whhat are the peak sales periods?
### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked  with
``` sql
select * from  table 1
where cond=2
```
### Results and Finding:
Analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticiable peak during holiday season.
2. Product category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts
### Recommendation
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following action:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in category a
- Implement a customer segment strateg to target high-LTV customers effectively

### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue column because they would have afffected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few retailers even after the ommissions but even then we can still 
see that there is positive correlation between budget and number of votes with revenue
